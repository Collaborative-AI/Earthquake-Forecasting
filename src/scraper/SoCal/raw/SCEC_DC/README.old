       SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE DATA CENTER CATALOG FORMAT 
       -----------------------------------------------------------------
				 (04/11/00)  

The SCEDC catalog consists of hypocentral information for the following
time periods. 

			April 1, 1981 - January 31, 1983 
			July 13, 1983 - present

These time periods represent the time periods for which "digital" waveform
and phase arrival data are available from the SCEDC, and for which events
have been completely processed by the Southern California Seismic Network.

The SCEDC catalog is complete for local events greater than or equal to 
M1.8 since 1981. The time gap in 1983 represents data where the
Southern California Seismographic Network has not completely processed the 
events, and made hypocenters, magnitudes and phase data available to the
Data Center.  

   SCEDC format catalog data (described below) are stored in
yearly ascii *.catalog files.

					***** BUYER BEWARE *****
					Event qualities are highly suspect prior
					to 1990.  Many of these event qualities
					are based on incomplete information.
					Also, they are really only applicable
					to LOCAL events
