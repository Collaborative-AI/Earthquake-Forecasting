To prevent triggering the request limit, the catalog was extracted from
the website year by year. NorCalScraper.py merges all the results into
one CSV file.

Summary:
The raw folder contains all the double_difference_XXXX.txt files found on
the Google Drive, where XXXX represents an year in the range [1984, 2023].

All the results are compiled in a CSV file named "NCEDC (1984-2023).csv"
